# Web Application Penetration Testing Suite

## Overview

The **Web Application Penetration Testing Suite** is a powerful and modular toolkit designed for professional security assessments of web applications. It provides tools for reconnaissance, vulnerability scanning, network port analysis, API integrations, and reporting. This suite is built with extensibility in mind, allowing future additions of plugins and functionality.

## Features

### Reconnaissance
- **DNS Information**: Fetches DNS records of the target.
- **WHOIS Lookup**: Retrieves WHOIS details for the domain.
- **Link Discovery**: Extracts links from the target web page for crawling.
- **Server Headers**: Inspects HTTP response headers for valuable information.

### Vulnerability Scanning
- **SQL Injection**: Detects improper sanitization of database queries.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Identifies reflective or stored XSS vulnerabilities.
- **Command Injection**: Finds vulnerabilities allowing shell command execution.
- **File Inclusion**: Scans for Local and Remote File Inclusion vulnerabilities.
- **Path Traversal**: Detects flaws allowing directory traversal.

### Network Scanning
- Scans specified ports on a target IP address or domain.
- Identifies open ports and detects the services running on them.

### API Integration
- **VirusTotal**: Scans URLs for malicious activity.
- **Shodan**: Fetches server exposure details and network intelligence.

### Reporting
- Generates reports in multiple formats, including **TXT** and **JSON**.
- Consolidates results from different tools for professional documentation.

### Extensibility
- Plugin-based architecture for seamless integration of custom scripts and tools.
